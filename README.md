# coach_scheduler
web app for coordinating appointments between a coach and a client.  This is a development exercise to demonstrate abilities and to learn something new.

# try it out
A demo of the app is now live [here](https://arcane-falls-25124.herokuapp.com)  Use username:Joe pass:joe, or username:Bob pass:bob

# problem
- two types of users: clients and coaches
- clients are assigned coaches
- clients need to schedule coaching calls on a monthly basis. 
- create a web based experience that makes it easy for clients to schedule a call. 
- clients should be able to see their coachâ€™s availability and then book hour long coaching slot. 
- once a slot is booked, other clients should not be able to book that slot with the same coach. 

# approach
- node, express, React web application.  I've used node and express along with backbone.js to create a single page web app before, but I've never used React.  Take this as an opportunity to learn React, and possibly Redux.
- If possible, put the project into a continuous integration workflow, as an opportunity to learn more about that.  As in: https://egghead.io/series/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library

# assumptions/intentionally skipped
- sign in (create new account)
- coach interface, where coach would set their office hours
- enforced coach assignment (understood that client-coach relationships are meant to be somewhat fixed, but I chose to allow scheduling of any appointment with any available coach for simplicity)

# architecture

# testing

# to do:
- continuous integration
- redux state
- docker deployment
- better logging (Winston or Bunyan?)
- more test coverage
- lint
- prettier login
