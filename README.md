# coach_scheduler
Web app for coordinating appointments between a coach and a client.  This is a development exercise to demonstrate abilities and to learn something new.

# try it out
A demo of the app is now live [here](https://arcane-falls-25124.herokuapp.com)  Use username:Joe pass:joe, or username:Bob pass:bob

## problem
- two types of users: clients and coaches
- clients need to schedule coaching calls on a monthly basis. 
- create a web based experience that makes it easy for clients to schedule a call. 
- clients should be able to see their coachâ€™s availability and then book hour long coaching slot. 
- once a slot is booked, other clients should not be able to book that slot with the same coach. 

## goals
- single page web app
- clean & simple interface
- easy to use
- learn something

## stack
- node.js / express.js: web service and API
- mongoDB : persistent storage
- mongoose.js : object data mapping
- React : front end view components

## other libraries/components
- FullCalendar : jquery calendar component
- Passport : authentication for node.js
- SemanticUI : css and js styles, transitions, look and feel, themes
- Mocha, Chai, Supertest: unit testing

## assumptions & intentionally skipped
- Didn't implement sign up form.  Just use test accounts.
- No coach interface.  It is assumed that they would have an admin page where they would set their office hours, etc.
- No enforced coach assignment (understood that client-coach relationships are meant to be somewhat fixed, but I chose to allow scheduling of any appointment with any available coach for simplicity)

## to do:
- Continuous Integration 
- Redux: for better encapsulation of application state
- Docker deployment
- Better logging (Winston or Bunyan?)
- More test coverage
- lint
- responsive design
- data-push
- API security
