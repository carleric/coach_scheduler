# coach_scheduler
web app for coordinating appointments between a coach and a client.  this is a development exercise meant to demonstrate my full stack dev capabilities.

#problem
- two types of users: clients and coaches
- clients are assigned coaches
- clients need to schedule coaching calls on a monthly basis. 
- create a web based experience that makes it easy for clients to schedule a call. 
- clients should be able to see their coachâ€™s availability and then book hour long coaching slot. 
- once a slot is booked, other clients should not be able to book that slot with the same coach. 

# to do:
- create express app skeleton
- ensure dependencies are managed with npm (package.json) and bower (bower.json)
- dockerize the app

#libraries under consideration
- lodash
-ical-toolkit
-node-calendar
